Pitch black darkness of the hallway drowned in the scent of burnt metal and expired machine oil. Every corner, every angle of the hallway hummed with a low, rhythmic beating of an electrical heart. In the midst of this alive corpse of a place, a piece of the ground ripped open, letting beams of faint blood red light in.

A mechanical skeleton, a hand of mismatched cables and steel bars reached out and grabbed onto anything within it's reach. Whatever at the other side was, it did not care for the ground, it kept digging. The beam of light went away at times and came back, like the headlights of a car passing by a window. The crack kept getting wider and then another hand reached out, as if it desperately was gasping for air.

The crack creaked open, even wider. The arms reached for a hot pipe and pulled in a mismatch of metallic junk vaguely shaped like the silhouette of a human, turning around it's head and two eyeballs, emitting out that very blood red light. It slowly crawled out of it's way, trying it's best to not tangle the cables and small pipes making out it's legs. It makes sounds of electric motors and hydraulic pistons alike, and sometimes a beep. It's chest had a rotating piece, part of it exposed. It's head and some cables going down it's curved spine had red and green faint lights scattered in a randomly order.

It raised its foot and held onto its knee, slowly standing on the humming ground. It looked around, like a radar scanning the environment, looking for something. It stared at the wall, made of fallen panels and exposed hot pipes and wires, letting out steam and sparks occasionally. Then it looked at the damaged pipe on the ground, exhausting liquid nitrogen from multiple spots, all exposed. Then it looked down both ways of the hallway. It took a moment of stillness to think.

A thump went ignored, but the second and third were rare, so rare that the steel corpse turned its head to see what it was. Red glow of the eyes lighting the walls blinked once, listening, curious, unsure. Something heavy fell down, it could have been a regular break down, three thousand of age wears things down. But then the sound of metal being violently dragged filled the hallway. This was not ordinary.

The creature of steel was frozen like a bunny in front of headlights, it could not process, it was scared of the unknown. The voice of the dragging kept going, coming closer and lauder. Whatever was moving that thing, it was something powerful, ruthless. The chassis inside the chest of the scared animated figure sped up. It took a step backwards, the sound of its metal foot hitting the ground got lost in all the noise. Alas the curiosity and fear, the darkness did not let it see the source whatsoever.

Then abruptly, the noise stopped, and it was replaced by the sound of footsteps. It was not metallic.

The robot flinched, its innerworkings started working faster, tenser. The cables, the steel, copper, gold and iron making up its body suddenly felt too heavy to carry. It needed to know, but it did not want to die. This was not ordinary.

It could not blink, its eyes kept illuminating the invisible footsteps, creeping closer and closer, with the hopes of sight.

First, the silhouette appeared, it did not look familiar. The structure was not at all exposed, as if waxed, smooth. It felt squishy. It had tens of thousands of thin strands all over its head. It was alien, and it was silent. No electric motor running, no hydraulic pistons moving, no cables brushing each other. Only the movement.

As it got closer and closer to the misshapen robot, its shape was clearly seen in the red light.

It was a human! A woman, with her war torn face and unmoving gaze, in the flesh. Her skin was covered in dirt, ashes and sweat. Her hair had bright dots of ash. She looked fit, well fed-even. Her walk was not one of tired, it was powerful, confident, filled with drive and power with clenched fists and a straight posture. The tank top she wore had lost its original color, now dirtied with black and brown all over. Her pants clearly held lots of tools, maybe resources. It was quite the rarest sight, but she had one thing that even scared the cold metal.

Her face. Her face had a wide grin, an unmerciful frown and eyes manically shot open. Her face screamed she had bring death, and will not listen to anyone or anything in her way. It was not the face a survivor would have. It was not a face a warrior would have. I was not a face a human being could ever have. That face stared right into the soul of this mechanical animatronic fused of cold metal, and the metal was scared.

The pile of steel fled like a deer in sight of a lion. Its feet betrayed it's new unplanned trajectory at first, but kept its balance. The figure of a human in this hellish dead planet could never be a good sign. It did not want to die! It could not die!

The woman did not run behind it, and when it looked back it saw the human peel the hundreds of degree hot steam pipes like the peel of an apple, and walk through liquid nitrogen as it it was mere steam.

It saw a corner to turn and find safety. It got so close that it could have touched the corner, but a thrown copper pipe hit it in the legs. It to rolled and hit a wall violently. It took a moment for its sensors to adjust. When it came to it's senses, the woman was running at him at the speed of a cheetah. She was determined, for whatever she was planning.

The robot held onto anything on the wall and stood up, all of its motors were overclocking. The moment it gained back balance, an organic fist clenched its body to the wall. It was no force a human could wield. The sensors recorded her face, as if a starving predator looking at the greatest feast of its life.

Then she ripped its arm off and threw it on the ground, the sound of metal hitting and drifting on the steel ground echoed throughout the dead hallways. Hydraulic fluid leaked and formed a little puddle until its automatic valves clicked and stopped the bleeding.

The woman slowly crept into its view as it desperately tried to crawl away. It had lost its energy and mobility, only thing it could do was to stare death dead in the eye. It tried to cry, but it had no tears. She was still smiling, grinning like a maniac. She stood beside the malfunctioning machine before kneeling down and making her way towards its chest.

The pain, the error logs, the continuous warning beeps, it was unbearable.

The last thing its auditory sensors record one last thing before being shut off while it was skinned alive by this horrific organic creature...

"So many complex pieces... This is gonna be fun."
